# Movie-Recommendatio-System(Content Based Recommendation System)
This recommendation system  is a content-based recommendation system. 

Here's why:

1. **Input**: The recommendation is based on the similarity between movies' content, specifically their tags. Each movie is represented as a vector of tag counts, and similarity is calculated based on these vectors.

2. **No User Data**: This system does not rely on user-item interactions or user preferences. It solely focuses on the characteristics of items (movies) themselves.

3. **Cosine Similarity**: The cosine similarity metric is used to measure the similarity between movies' content vectors. Cosine similarity is a common choice in content-based recommendation systems.

4. **Recommendation Process**: Given a movie title, the system finds the most similar movies based on their content similarity, without considering other users' preferences or behavior.

Therefore, this code implements a content-based recommendation system, where recommendations are made based on the similarity of items' attributes or content.
